description: How to migrate from v2 to v3
---

Nuxt Content v3 had been rebuilt from the ground up, resulting in a new library with enhanced capabilities. While we've redesigned concepts and components in a similar way as Content v2, breaking changes are inevidible. 

Don't worry, you don't need to modify your content files, We made sure that Content v3 handles content in the same was as Content v2.

Here is the list breaking changes in Content v3:

- Document driven mode is fully droped, meaning:
  - Markdown files will not convert to Nuxt pages automatically, you need to create pages, see [how](/components/content-renderer#example)
  - `useContent()`{lang=ts} composable is removed
  - `useContentHead()`{lang=ts} composable is removed
- We simplified rendering components.
  - `<ContentDoc>`, `<ContentList>`, `<ContentNavigation>` and `<ContentQuery>` components are dropped in v3.
- `queryContent()`{lang=ts} API is dropped in favor of new `queryCollection()`{lang=ts}
  - New API is backed by SQL
  - New API search contents within the specific collection
- `_dir.yml` files are renamed to `.navigation.yml`
