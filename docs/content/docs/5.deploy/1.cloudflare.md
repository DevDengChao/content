Nuxt Content uses Nuxt deployment presets to adjust the build process for different hosting platforms.

If you use the [Cloudflare Pages GitHub/GitLab integration][1]{target="_blank"} Nuxt will detect it and use the `cloudflare-pages`{lang="ts-type"} preset automatically.

In order to publish your project, you need to create a Cloudflare D1 database and connect it to your project.

[Learn how to create a D1 database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/get-started/#2-create-a-database)

## Database

Unfortunately SQLite database is not supported in cloudflare environment and you should use another database.
You can simply create a D1 database in cloudflare and use Content Module's D1 adapter.

- Use [Nuxt Hub](/docs/deploy/nuxthub) to create, connect and manage D1 database for you.
- Or create a D1 database from Cloudflare dashboard and connect it to you project by creating a `wrangler.toml` file in project root. [Get started with Cloudflare D1][d1]
