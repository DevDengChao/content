Nuxt Content uses Nuxt deployment presets to adjust the build process for different hosting platforms. To deploy your Nuxt Content to Cloudflare, you can use the `cloudflare-pages`{lang="ts-type"} preset.

You can do that in two ways:

- By defining the `NITRO_PRESET`{lang="ts-type"} to `cloudflare_pages`{lang="ts-type"} when running the build process, like so:

```bash
NITRO_PRESET=cloudflare_pages npm run build
```

Or by updating your Nuxt configuration:

```bash
"preset": "cloudflare_pages",
```

If you use the [Cloudflare Pages GitHub/GitLab integration][1]{target="_blank"} Nuxt does not require configuration for presets.

## Database

Unfortunately SQLite database is not supported in cloudflare environment and you should use another database.
You can simply create a D1 database in cloudflare and use Content Module's D1 adapter.

- Use [Nuxt Hub](/deploy/nuxthub) to create, connect and manage D1 database for you.
- Or create a D1 database from Cloudflare dashboard and connect it to you project by creating a `wrangler.toml` file in project root. [Get started with Cloudflare D1][d1]
